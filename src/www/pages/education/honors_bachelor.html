                Honors for Bachelor students
            </h1>

            <h4>You are in the lead</h4>
            <p> In the Track of your choice you are challenged to take the lead in your own development and in the
                project you are
                doing. You get the chance to work together with students from other departments, to meet inspiring
                coaches, to
                explore the forefront of knowledge and to meet with people from industry. Dive into your own discipline
                or explore
                other disciplines, it’s all up to you.
            </p>

            <h4>Investment and Competition</h4>
            <p> The honors work will be on top of your regular study in the second and third year, and requires a time
                investment of
                about 10 hours per week (840 hours in total; 30 credits). It is divided in two parts of 15 credits each.
                After the
                first part your progress and the quality of your work are assessed. This is also a moment of reflection
                on
                continuing your honors work or not, in the same Track or in another one. Successful completion of the
                full honors
                program is mentioned on your Bachelor’s diploma, you receive a letter of recommendation and obtain 30
                additional
                credits. If you only complete the first part you get a certificate and 15 additional credits.
            </p>
