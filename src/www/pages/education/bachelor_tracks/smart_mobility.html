    Smart Mobility
</h1>
<p>At TU/e Smart Mobility we see many opportunities to use the potential of technology to solve the problems of mobility
    by adding smartness to it aiming to decrease these negative effects down to 0%. Within the Smart Mobility track of
    the Honors Academy we would like to challenge you to develop yourself in generating out-of-the-box ground breaking
    new mobility concepts.</p>
<h3>Autonomous Car</h3>
<p>In last two years the honors students in the smart mobility track have worked together on the design of an automated
    system of autonomous cars for the city of Eindhoven, on the aspects of design of the overall urban mobility system,
    the business plan, the App design, the digital world representation and vehicle control. The team consists of
    students from quite different disciplines: built environment, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering,
    industrial design and informatics. For the team a Renault Twizy is available for implementing core technologies and
    doing experiments with user focus groups.</p>
<h3>University Raceteam Eindhoven</h3>
<p>University Racing Eindhoven (URE) is one of the largest student teams at Eindhoven University of Technology. Each
    year, the team members design and manufacture an electric race car together from scratch, to compete in
    international Formula Student competitions all over the world. Starting this year, URE has taken on the challenge
    to, next to the regular electric class, compete in the autonomous driving class as well. To achieve that goal the
    team has started ‘Project Prime’, converting one of the older race car models into the first autonomous racecar of
    the Benelux. Different than other Honors projects, Project Prime is completely independent of the Honors Academy.
    You get to learn how to function within a far larger interdisciplinary team (+/- 70 people) on a faster-pasted and
    more high-tech project with practical application. Doing it as part of your Honors project means you get the best of
    both worlds. You can take all that working at Project Prime has to offer, without losing the oversight and focus on
    your own personal development that the Honors Academy emphasizes in the process. If you are eager to learn more
