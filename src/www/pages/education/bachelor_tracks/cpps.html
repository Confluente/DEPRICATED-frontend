    Competitive Programming and Problem Solving
</h1>
<p>Smart and efficient algorithms are underlying many broadly used applications in everyday life. Nowadays, the
    development of software applications is at the forefront of technological innovation. Large tech companies are
    scouting students that are proficient in algorithmic problem solving and can work in teams on efficient
    implementation. In that sense, programming contests can be considered a top sport. Skills such as teamwork and
    working under time pressure are required, and a student will need both talent and experience to be successful. Like
    many sports, simply practicing over and over again will help a lot!</p>
<h3>First Year</h3>
<p>After the first few weeks, teams of three will be formed. The first contest you will participate in is the EAPC =
    Eindhoven Algorithmic Programming contest in early October. Based on its results the team will define its ambition
    for the rest of the year (and beyond) and design its own training program.</p>
<h3>Second Year</h3>
<p>In the second year new teams are formed and new, more challenging ambitions will be formulated. Here, your career
    perspectives have to be taken into account, since programming contests offer contacts you might want to use to
    direct your career For example to arrange an international semester at a university of your choice, an internship at
    a specific company, or a Summer School at Google.</p>
