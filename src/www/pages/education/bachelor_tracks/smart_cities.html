    Smart Cities
</h1>
<p>Smart Cities addresses a variety of topics from the perspective that smart and innovative solutions are required for
    the built environment. Implementing these solutions is challenging; life in a city is dynamic because of the
    numerous participants that are involved, all with different needs, interests, and expectations. Further challenges
    include the jumble of clear and unclear interaction of users, and the continuous developments in boundary
    conditions. Yet, on the other hand cities are quite static too, as it takes many years, many time-consuming
    administrative measures, and often judicial processes to implement a real reform. A process of 10 years from idea to
    implementation is rather the rule than the exception for urban changes.</p>
<h3>Lectures</h3>
<p>To facilitate the selection of a specific topic in the scope of Smart Cities, we first start with a compact series of
    lectures/talks/discussions, organized by the participating students. At the start, we will ask students to form
    groups of two or three, and to select a specific topic for gathering information. As a result, each group prepares
    one specific topic that will be discussed in a mutual meeting. Each group will invite an expert, arrange discussion
    (or brainstorm), etcetera.</p>
<h3>Team Composition</h3>
<p>After completion of the initial series of lectures/talks/discussions, we expect all students of this honor track to
    be familiar with several topics regarding Smart Cities (and are also acquainted to one another), we start with the
    assignments by making teams of 3-6 student on a specific theme. In consultation with the track coordinator students
    will formulate a dedicated assignment and address the definition of the problem.</p>
