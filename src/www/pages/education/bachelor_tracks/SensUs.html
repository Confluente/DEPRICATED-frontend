<h3>Student competition on biosensors for health</h3>
<p>The mission of SensUs is to stimulate the development of biosensors in a friendly but competitive manner, whereby
    students make and design innovative biosensors. Each year, a societally impactful indicator of health is chosen as
    an objective in collaboration with different stakeholders.</p>
<p>An important aim in healthcare is to keep people healthy as long as possible and to enable people in need of care to
    live a high-quality life in their own environments. Healthcare is developing toward a world wherein care is
    delivered in a highly personalized manner, attuned to the status of the patient, based on actual, precise and
    reliable data.</p>
<p>SensUs stimulates information sharing and community development for continuous innovation in biosensors. It forms a
    platform for open innovation and welcomes stakeholders such as healthcare organizations, patient organizations, R&D
    funding organizations, and companies to give input for the competition (e.g. regarding the technical goals of the
    competition) or otherwise support the competition.</p>
<h3>Teams</h3>
<p>The current organization consists of four subgroups: Technology, Events, External Relations and Media; supported by a
    chair, vice-chair, treasurer and secretary. The organization is multidisciplinary, since there are many different
    aspects in organizing an international competition. You are stimulated to take initiative and let your creativity
    flow.</p>
