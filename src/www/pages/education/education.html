<h1>Education</h1>
<p>The Honors education is provided by the TU/e <a href="https://educationguide.tue.nl/programs/tue-honors-academy/">Honors Academy</a>.</p>
<p>Students have many different tracks to choose from. Below is what students say about their own track.</p>
<h3>SensUs - Alissa Buskermolen</h3>
<p>SensUs is the international competition on molecular biosensors for healthcare applications. In a multidisciplinary team (all majors are welcome) we work on organizing an exciting and fast-growing competition that focuses on boosting the field of molecular biosensing and improving healthcare. Usually the process of building a novel biosensor is around 10 to 15 years, but the teams that participate in our competition build their own biosensor in just 9 months. Since the beginning of 2015 we have been working on putting SensUs on the map, and this year 10 teams from three different continents are participating.</p>
<p>In our organization several divisions work on different aspects of the competition. Our Technology division for instance recruits the jury members, determines the assessment criteria and prepares all the test samples for the competition. The Events division arranges all logistical aspects like the location, accommodation and catering. Our Media division mainly focusses on promoting SensUs by maintaining our website, posting on social media and organizing and visiting external events. On top of these divisions we have chair, vice-chair, secretary, treasurer and external relations functions to keep everything running smoothly.</p>
<p>I joined the SensUs organization because I really needed an extra challenge on top of the regular curriculum and the first year I mainly wanted to improve my planning, communication, and organizational skills, and I liked the idea of working in a multidisciplinary team. This year I joined the Technology division because I wanted to gain more in depth knowledge about the biomarker, spend some more time in the lab and improve my academic writing skills. At the moment I am mainly working on the Jury process and composition, and we are very busy with reference testing both on the campus and in the Catharina hospital.</p>
<p>If you like a bit of everything then joining the SensUs organization is the perfect choice. You are very free to do the types of activities that you like and work on the skills you want to improve. Whether that includes maintaining our website, designing promotional materials, arranging everything for our campsite, or something else entirely, is up to you!</p>

<h3>Smart Mobility - Cameron Weibel</h3>
<p>At Smart Mobility, we are working on building an autonomous Renault Twizy. I chose this track because my passion is robotics, and this project gives me the ability to work in a group of interdisciplinary students on a modern initiative. I believe the honors tracks should provide possibilities normally inaccessible to students working on their own, and with Smart Mobility we have the opportunity to work with advanced hardware/software used by industry, with top researchers in their departments.</p>
<p>Currently, the Twizy can steer, throttle, and brake by wire. We are working now on integrating these components together into a demo where the Twizy will autonomously follow a lead vehicle driven by a human.
For future applicants, I would implore you to join our team if you have the intellectual curiosity and motivation to work towards autonomous vehicles.</p>

<h3>Energy Transition - Steven Kuijpers</h3>
<p>In the Energy Transition track we are working on, as the name implies, expediting the global energy transition. There are many ways to do this, and for this reason the project you will be working on in this track is not pre-determined. You can for example work on developing metal fuels as a new energy carrier, or work on the design of a new home which is energy- and space efficient as well as user friendly. In my project I am working on the design of a pyrolysis installation which Thai farmers can use to create an organic substitute for pesticides, using their own leftover wood.</p>
<p>To me the best part about the Energy Transition track is that instead of working on exercises conceived solely for practice, here you will be working towards solving real life problems in teams of highly motivated students. In the Energy Transition track it is also possible to come up with your own projects.</p>
<p>Because the problems we are facing in the energy transition are very broad, working in interdisciplinary teams is essential, and for this reason all disciplines are welcome. </p>
<p>If working on energy related projects sounds like a fun challenge to you, I would advise you to come by one of the information events to see what is possible.</p>

<h3>Big Data - Boy Raaijmakers</h3>
<p>As a first year mathematics student, I decided to join the Big Data track because of my ambition to put my mathematical knowledge to the test in a practical environment. As Data Scientist, one has the responsibility to dive into lots of data from a company and find as much value as possible for them.</p>
<p>What started as mining simple data did, however, soon turn out to be much more than just the theory and software.</p>
<p>In my current project, I am working on data from UWV (Dutch governmental unemployment benefit company). In this project, our group is responsible for mining data from their web applications and trying to find interesting correlations in user behavior. After finding as much as possible useful information, we got to present it to the company.Imagine yourself in a room full of web developers and you standing there talking about how they could have done their job better. One does not only have the opportunity to analyze the data, but also the responsibility of bringing the results back to the professionals.</p>
<p>The Honors Academy gave me this opportunity. The opportunity to not only use my knowledge to real world data, but also to test and improve my social communication and business oriented skills. An opportunity I would have never gotten in my regular major program. Are you a student who is eager to dive into the haystack, look for that needle and bring it to a company, then Big Data is the place to be for you.</p>

<h3>High Tech Systems - Ahmed Ahres</h3>
<p>As a first year Computer Science student, I decided to join the High Tech Systems track because I wanted to work on a sexy project with a multi-disciplinary team. I am also very interested in applying Artificial Intelligence to Computer Vision, and found that drones were an excellent example to be able to learn that. I was also extremely motivated by learning things outside of my department, such as control systems in order to have a deep and broad knowledge of technology.</p>
<p>Right now, I have just decided to join a team building an Autonomous Racing Drone called Cyclone. In the very first six months of the honors track, we followed lectures and completed assignments with the drone. The assignments were about calibrating the sensors, understand and implementing a control system mainly. Now, I am focusing on the Software part of this racing drone. </p>
<p>Last but not least, I would advise people that are interested in drones and want to learn advanced topics that are not in any of the Bachelor program to follow this track. It is extremely cool to be able to work on quadcopters that will probably be part of the next big thing, along with virtual reality and self-driving cars.</p>

<h3>Competitive Programming &amp; Problem Solving - Herman Galioulline</h3>
<p>Being in Computer science I have always been interested in software and solving problems using computation. It was basically a no brainer for me to join competitive programming and problem solving; I wanted to learn how to harness the power of computation to achieve that which before would be unthinkable. I was also looking forward to the freedom that the track provides. I can choose which programming competitions to compete in, which projects to work on and which topics to research. At the beginning of the year we had a Google employee talk to the entire track about his experience with developing NFC for Android. Just recently I competed in Google Hashcode---a competition where we were tasked with optimizing the video-serving infrastructure to handle requests reliably and quickly. I was also interested in developing my Linux and web development skills so I joined a project on improving the competitive programming server which we recently upgraded. Finally, I am looking to do research in neural networks for my master's so I presented a lecture on that topic to other students in the track. </p>
<p>This track gives you many opportunities to develop yourself in any direction you choose with computer science expertise available to you whenever you would need it. If any of the above resonates with you I would highly recommend you to apply for this track.</p>

<h3>Empowerment for HealthCare and Well-Being - Vera van Otterdijk</h3>
<p>The empowerment for health and wellbeing track was the best choice for me because it focuses on developing products and services. As an industrial design student that aligned best with my regular coursework. Moreover I like the underlying societal mission of helping people take control of their own wellbeing.</p>
<p>My team is currently working on Plan-it, a self-learning system which helps children with autism become more independent through supporting them in developing their planning skills. Last year this project landed us in the finals of the TU/e contest.</p>
<p>Any future applicants I would advise to choose carefully. Visit multiple tracks, talk to students, and seriously consider if you have the time and dedication to put ten hours a week into extracurricular work. Then once you are in the honors academy, make sure to spend time in the honors room. Through the big glass wall we might look like a zoo exhibit of nerdy hermits, but we are actually nice and interesting people.</p>

<h3>Smart Cities - Carmen Korevaar</h3>
<p>The track Smart Cities is addressing one of the most important aspects of the future: sustainability.
Within the built environment, sustainability creates challenges on different levels, from urban to housing scale.
Our Smart Cities Honors track of 2015 became a student team of the Eindhoven University of Technology,
As we are participating in the Solar Decathlon Middle East Competition in Dubai, 2018.
The goal is to design, build and operate an as sustainable and innovative as possible solarhouse.
Also, the requirement of the worldwide competition is to completely build our zero energy house in just 10 days.
In the Solar Decathlon Middle East, 22 teams of different universities around the world are competing.
A jury will criticize the houses at 10 different contests, varying from ‘Architecture’ to ‘Sustainable Transportation’ and ‘Energy Efficiency’.
Our team, VIRTUe, is versatile, combining the knowledge of different faculties of the Eindhoven University of Technology.
Without the Smart Cities Honors track we would never had the opportunity to start this great challenge!
If you are interested in sustainability projects, willing to put effort for reaching your goals, broaden your experience and knowledge about the built environment, apply to the Smart Cities Honors track and address your own challenge!</p>
