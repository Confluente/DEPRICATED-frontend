<!--<h3>SensUs - Alissa Buskermolen</h3>-->
<!--<p>SensUs is the international competition on molecular biosensors for healthcare applications. In a multidisciplinary-->
<!--    team (all majors are welcome) we work on organizing an exciting and fast-growing competition that focuses on-->
<!--    boosting the field of molecular biosensing and improving healthcare. Usually the process of building a novel-->
<!--    biosensor is around 10 to 15 years, but the teams that participate in our competition build their own biosensor in-->
<!--    just 9 months. Since the beginning of 2015 we have been working on putting SensUs on the map, and this year 10 teams-->
<!--    from three different continents are participating.</p>-->
<!--<p>In our organization several divisions work on different aspects of the competition. Our Technology division for-->
<!--    instance recruits the jury members, determines the assessment criteria and prepares all the test samples for the-->
<!--    competition. The Events division arranges all logistical aspects like the location, accommodation and catering. Our-->
<!--    Media division mainly focusses on promoting SensUs by maintaining our website, posting on social media and-->
<!--    organizing and visiting external events. On top of these divisions we have chair, vice-chair, secretary, treasurer-->
<!--    and external relations functions to keep everything running smoothly.</p>-->
<!--<p>I joined the SensUs organization because I really needed an extra challenge on top of the regular curriculum and the-->
<!--    first year I mainly wanted to improve my planning, communication, and organizational skills, and I liked the idea of-->
<!--    working in a multidisciplinary team. This year I joined the Technology division because I wanted to gain more in-->
<!--    depth knowledge about the biomarker, spend some more time in the lab and improve my academic writing skills. At the-->
<!--    moment I am mainly working on the Jury process and composition, and we are very busy with reference testing both on-->
<!--    the campus and in the Catharina hospital.</p>-->
<!--<p>If you like a bit of everything then joining the SensUs organization is the perfect choice. You are very free to do-->
<!--    the types of activities that you like and work on the skills you want to improve. Whether that includes maintaining-->
<!--    our website, designing promotional materials, arranging everything for our campsite, or something else entirely, is-->
<!--    up to you!</p>-->

<!--<h3>Smart Mobility - Cameron Weibel</h3>-->
<!--<p>At Smart Mobility, we are working on building an autonomous Renault Twizy. I chose this track because my passion is-->
<!--    robotics, and this project gives me the ability to work in a group of interdisciplinary students on a modern-->
<!--    initiative. I believe the honors tracks should provide possibilities normally inaccessible to students working on-->
<!--    their own, and with Smart Mobility we have the opportunity to work with advanced hardware/software used by industry,-->
<!--    with top researchers in their departments.</p>-->
<!--<p>Currently, the Twizy can steer, throttle, and brake by wire. We are working now on integrating these components-->
<!--    together into a demo where the Twizy will autonomously follow a lead vehicle driven by a human.-->
<!--    For future applicants, I would implore you to join our team if you have the intellectual curiosity and motivation to-->
<!--    work towards autonomous vehicles.</p>-->

<!--<h3>Energy Transition - Steven Kuijpers</h3>-->
<!--<p>In the Energy Transition track we are working on, as the name implies, expediting the global energy transition. There-->
<!--    are many ways to do this, and for this reason the project you will be working on in this track is not-->
<!--    pre-determined. You can for example work on developing metal fuels as a new energy carrier, or work on the design of-->
<!--    a new home which is energy- and space efficient as well as user friendly. In my project I am working on the design-->
<!--    of a pyrolysis installation which Thai farmers can use to create an organic substitute for pesticides, using their-->
<!--    own leftover wood.</p>-->
<!--<p>To me the best part about the Energy Transition track is that instead of working on exercises conceived solely for-->
<!--    practice, here you will be working towards solving real life problems in teams of highly motivated students. In the-->
<!--    Energy Transition track it is also possible to come up with your own projects.</p>-->
<!--<p>Because the problems we are facing in the energy transition are very broad, working in interdisciplinary teams is-->
<!--    essential, and for this reason all disciplines are welcome. </p>-->
<!--<p>If working on energy related projects sounds like a fun challenge to you, I would advise you to come by one of the-->
<!--    information events to see what is possible.</p>-->

<!--<h3>Big Data - Boy Raaijmakers</h3>-->
<!--<p>As a first year mathematics student, I decided to join the Big Data track because of my ambition to put my-->
<!--    mathematical knowledge to the test in a practical environment. As Data Scientist, one has the responsibility to dive-->
<!--    into lots of data from a company and find as much value as possible for them.</p>-->
<!--<p>What started as mining simple data did, however, soon turn out to be much more than just the theory and software.</p>-->
<!--<p>In my current project, I am working on data from UWV (Dutch governmental unemployment benefit company). In this-->
<!--    project, our group is responsible for mining data from their web applications and trying to find interesting-->
<!--    correlations in user behavior. After finding as much as possible useful information, we got to present it to the-->
<!--    company.Imagine yourself in a room full of web developers and you standing there talking about how they could have-->
<!--    done their job better. One does not only have the opportunity to analyze the data, but also the responsibility of-->
<!--    bringing the results back to the professionals.</p>-->
<!--<p>The Honors Academy gave me this opportunity. The opportunity to not only use my knowledge to real world data, but-->
<!--    also to test and improve my social communication and business oriented skills. An opportunity I would have never-->
<!--    gotten in my regular major program. Are you a student who is eager to dive into the haystack, look for that needle-->
<!--    and bring it to a company, then Big Data is the place to be for you.</p>-->

<!--<h3>High Tech Systems - Ahmed Ahres</h3>-->
<!--<p>As a first year Computer Science student, I decided to join the High Tech Systems track because I wanted to work on a-->
<!--    sexy project with a multi-disciplinary team. I am also very interested in applying Artificial Intelligence to-->
<!--    Computer Vision, and found that drones were an excellent example to be able to learn that. I was also extremely-->
<!--    motivated by learning things outside of my department, such as control systems in order to have a deep and broad-->
<!--    knowledge of technology.</p>-->
<!--<p>Right now, I have just decided to join a team building an Autonomous Racing Drone called Cyclone. In the very first-->
<!--    six months of the honors track, we followed lectures and completed assignments with the drone. The assignments were-->
<!--    about calibrating the sensors, understand and implementing a control system mainly. Now, I am focusing on the-->
<!--    Software part of this racing drone. </p>-->
<!--<p>Last but not least, I would advise people that are interested in drones and want to learn advanced topics that are-->
<!--    not in any of the Bachelor program to follow this track. It is extremely cool to be able to work on quadcopters that-->
<!--    will probably be part of the next big thing, along with virtual reality and self-driving cars.</p>-->

<!--<h3>Competitive Programming &amp; Problem Solving - Herman Galioulline</h3>-->
<!--<p>Being in Computer science I have always been interested in software and solving problems using computation. It was-->
<!--    basically a no brainer for me to join competitive programming and problem solving; I wanted to learn how to harness-->
<!--    the power of computation to achieve that which before would be unthinkable. I was also looking forward to the-->
<!--    freedom that the track provides. I can choose which programming competitions to compete in, which projects to work-->
<!--    on and which topics to research. At the beginning of the year we had a Google employee talk to the entire track-->
<!--    about his experience with developing NFC for Android. Just recently I competed in Google Hashcode-&#45;&#45;a competition-->
<!--    where we were tasked with optimizing the video-serving infrastructure to handle requests reliably and quickly. I was-->
<!--    also interested in developing my Linux and web development skills so I joined a project on improving the competitive-->
<!--    programming server which we recently upgraded. Finally, I am looking to do research in neural networks for my-->
<!--    master's so I presented a lecture on that topic to other students in the track. </p>-->
<!--<p>This track gives you many opportunities to develop yourself in any direction you choose with computer science-->
<!--    expertise available to you whenever you would need it. If any of the above resonates with you I would highly-->
<!--    recommend you to apply for this track.</p>-->

<!--<h3>Empowerment for HealthCare and Well-Being - Vera van Otterdijk</h3>-->
<!--<p>The empowerment for health and wellbeing track was the best choice for me because it focuses on developing products-->
<!--    and services. As an industrial design student that aligned best with my regular coursework. Moreover I like the-->
<!--    underlying societal mission of helping people take control of their own wellbeing.</p>-->
<!--<p>My team is currently working on Plan-it, a self-learning system which helps children with autism become more-->
<!--    independent through supporting them in developing their planning skills. Last year this project landed us in the-->
<!--    finals of the TU/e contest.</p>-->
<!--<p>Any future applicants I would advise to choose carefully. Visit multiple tracks, talk to students, and seriously-->
<!--    consider if you have the time and dedication to put ten hours a week into extracurricular work. Then once you are in-->
<!--    the honors academy, make sure to spend time in the honors room. Through the big glass wall we might look like a zoo-->
<!--    exhibit of nerdy hermits, but we are actually nice and interesting people.</p>-->

<!--<h3>Smart Cities - Carmen Korevaar</h3>-->
<!--<p>The track Smart Cities is addressing one of the most important aspects of the future: sustainability.-->
<!--    Within the built environment, sustainability creates challenges on different levels, from urban to housing scale.-->
<!--    Our Smart Cities Honors track of 2015 became a student team of the Eindhoven University of Technology,-->
<!--    As we are participating in the Solar Decathlon Middle East Competition in Dubai, 2018.-->
<!--    The goal is to design, build and operate an as sustainable and innovative as possible solarhouse.-->
<!--    Also, the requirement of the worldwide competition is to completely build our zero energy house in just 10 days.-->
<!--    In the Solar Decathlon Middle East, 22 teams of different universities around the world are competing.-->
<!--    A jury will criticize the houses at 10 different contests, varying from ‘Architecture’ to ‘Sustainable-->
<!--    Transportation’ and ‘Energy Efficiency’.-->
<!--    Our team, VIRTUe, is versatile, combining the knowledge of different faculties of the Eindhoven University of-->
<!--    Technology.-->
<!--    Without the Smart Cities Honors track we would never had the opportunity to start this great challenge!-->
<!--    If you are interested in sustainability projects, willing to put effort for reaching your goals, broaden your-->
<!--    experience and knowledge about the built environment, apply to the Smart Cities Honors track and address your own-->
<!--    challenge!</p>-->
