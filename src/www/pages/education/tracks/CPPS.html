              Smart and efficient algorithms are underlying many broadly used applications in everyday life. Nowadays, the
              development of software applications is at the forefront of technological innovation. Large tech companies are
              scouting students that are proficient in algorithmic problem solving and can work in teams on efficient
              implementation. In that sense, programming contests can be considered a top sport. Skills such as teamwork and
              working under time pressure are required, and a student will need both talent and experience to be successful. Like
              many sports, simply practicing over and over again will help a lot!

          <h4>First Year</h4>
          <p>
              After the first few weeks, teams of three will be formed. The first contest you will participate in is the EAPC =
              Eindhoven Algorithmic Programming contest in early October. Based on its results the team will define its ambition
              for the rest of the year (and beyond) and design its own training program.
          </p>

          <h4>Second Year</h4>
          <p>
              In the second year new teams are formed and new, more challenging ambitions will be formulated. Here, your career
              perspectives have to be taken into account, since programming contests offer contacts you might want to use to
              direct your career For example to arrange an international semester at a university of your choice, an internship at
              a specific company, or a Summer School at Google.
