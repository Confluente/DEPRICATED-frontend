        <p>Smart Cities addresses a variety of topics from the perspective that smart and innovative solutions are required for the built environment. Implementing these solutions is challenging; life in a city is dynamic because of the numerous participants that are involved, all with different needs, interests, and expectations. Further challenges include the jumble of clear and unclear interaction of users, and the continuous developments in boundary conditions. Yet, on the other hand cities are quite static too, as it takes many years, many time-consuming administrative measures, and often judicial processes to implement a real reform. A process of 10 years from idea to implementation is rather the rule than the exception for urban changes.</p>

        <h4>Lectures</h4>
        <p>To facilitate the selection of a specific topic in the scope of Smart Cities, we first start with a compact series of lectures/talks/discussions, organized by the participating students. At the start, we will ask students to form groups of two or three, and to select a specific topic for gathering information. As a result, each group prepares one specific topic that will be discussed in a mutual meeting. Each group will invite an expert, arrange discussion (or brainstorm), etcetera.</p>

        <h4>Team Composition</h4>
        <p>After completion of the initial series of lectures/talks/discussions, we expect all students of this honor track to be familiar with several topics regarding Smart Cities (and are also acquainted to one another), we start with the assignments by making teams of 3-6 student on a specific theme. In consultation with the track coordinator students will formulate a dedicated assignment and address the definition of the problem.</p>
