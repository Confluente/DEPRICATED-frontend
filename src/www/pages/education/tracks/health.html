            </h1>
            <p>
                Leading an unhealthy lifestyle is currently one of the main problems in western society. As a result,
                the costs of
                healthcare and increasing exponentially. This combination currently presents a huge societal but also an
                economical
                and organizational challenge. To give focus to the challenge at hand we pose the following question:
                “How do we get
                people to take responsibility for their own health and wellbeing?” You will try to tackle this problem
                by learning
                how to develop and design systems together with these people, in a real context and with a real client.
                Through
                advanced design processes you will learn about working with patients and therapists to develop physical
                or digital
                tools that empower people to take their problems into their own hands.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this Honors track you will conduct a 1-year project that you can define yourself by presenting your
                vision on the
                future of healthcare and wellbeing. Do you have an idea that empowers people or helps them manage their
                own personal
                wellbeing? Then in this track you will have to opportunity to bring that vision into reality! You will
                be inspired
                by lectures, workshops and company visits to companies such as Medtronic, Radboud UMC and more.

            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>
                The track consists of different groups each working on their own project. Below a short description of
                each
                group.
            </p>

            <h4>Rehabilitative opportunities</h4>
            <p>
                Our project looks to support the rehabilitative opportunities offered by the startup “GTX-medical”,
                whose treatment
                could provide patients with extended recovery of spinal cord injuries. We aim to do so by providing
                patients with a
                solution for home rehabilitation, through which they are able to properly perform the exercises provided
                by their
                therapist, without actual interference of said professional.
            </p>

            <h4>Workplace vitality</h4>
            <p>
                Mivo enables building occupants to give their subjective feedback on current air quality, temperature,
                light, and
                noise level – the environmental aspects that influence vitality and productivity. Every desk has its own
                Mivo
                allowing for localized feedback and a map overview of the workplace with suggestions for improvement
                based on the
                inputs. The collected data gets collected and analysed in the web-based system which would help facility
                management
                of offices to enable easier building performance assessments. Outcomes of these evaluations could
                improve the
                current building state and provide smart and efficient building management to create a healthy
                workspace.
            </p>

            <h4>JOS</h4>
            <p>
                Do you ever talk about a shared event with people, but it turns out they have completely different
                memories about it?
                This also happens in the communication between doctors and patients. After talking to patients, we found
                out that
                they miss an overview, due to the emotional aspects, the lack of the instruments to provide an overview,
                but also
                the information that is differently interpreted in a consult. We want to give breast cancer patients
                more insight
                about their treatment process to help them make the best fitting choices about their life. We designed a
                product
                that gives the opportunity for patients and doctors to construct the treatment plan of the patient.
                Personal
                triggering questions and visual information of the planning provided in the product will help to solve
                this problem.
                We hope to scale JOS to more target groups in the future.
