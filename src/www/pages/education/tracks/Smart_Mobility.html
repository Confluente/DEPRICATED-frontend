            <p>
                At TU/e Smart Mobility we see many opportunities to use the potential of technology to solve the
                problems of mobility
                by adding smartness to it aiming to decrease these negative effects down to 0%. Within the Smart
                Mobility track of
                the Honors Academy we would like to challenge you to develop yourself in generating out-of-the-box
                ground breaking
                new mobility concepts.

            <h4>Autonomous Car</h4>
            <p>
                In last two years the honors students in the smart mobility track have worked together on the design of
                an automated
                system of autonomous cars for the city of Eindhoven, on the aspects of design of the overall urban
                mobility system,
                the business plan, the App design, the digital world representation and vehicle control. The team
                consists of
                students from quite different disciplines: built environment, mechanical engineering, industrial
                engineering,
                industrial design and informatics. For the team a Renault Twizy is available for implementing core
                technologies and
                doing experiments with user focus groups.

            <h4>University Raceteam Eindhoven</h4>
            <p>
                University Racing Eindhoven (URE) is one of the largest student teams at Eindhoven University of
                Technology. Each
                year, the team members design and manufacture an electric race car together from scratch, to compete in
                international Formula Student competitions all over the world. Starting this year, URE has taken on the
                challenge
                to, next to the regular electric class, compete in the autonomous driving class as well. To achieve that
                goal the
                team has started ‘Project Prime’, converting one of the older race car models into the first autonomous
                racecar of
                the Benelux. Different than other Honors projects, Project Prime is completely independent of the Honors
                Academy.
                You get to learn how to function within a far larger interdisciplinary team (+/- 70 people) on a
                faster-pasted and
                more high-tech project with practical application. Doing it as part of your Honors project means you get
                the best of
                both worlds. You can take all that working at Project Prime has to offer, without losing the oversight
                and focus on
                your own personal development that the Honors Academy emphasizes in the process. If you are eager to
                learn more
