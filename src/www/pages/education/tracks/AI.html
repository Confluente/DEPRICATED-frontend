              In today’s connected world, data is everywhere and everybody talks about the analysis of “big data”. But what is this
              big data exactly and what can you do with it? In this track, you will learn about the state-of-the-art in data
              analysis through a number of company visits and literature. You will experience that data analysis requires more
              than just good mathematical algorithms, but also good visualization techniques and considerations of ethical
              issues.
          </p>

          <h4>First Year</h4>
          <p>
              You will dive into the world of big data analysis through process mining. You will learn how big data can add value
              to just about any company and you will enter into a real data analysis competition to show your skills.
          </p>

          <h4>Second Year</h4>
          <p>
              In the first year you experienced what it was like to analyze a given dataset to answer a concrete problem in the
              context of a competition where the data was prepared and the question was explicit. In this year, you will
              experience another side of big data, namely obtaining the right data to answer a customer question. In groups of
              five students at the most, you will be contacting a company looking for a data analysis question. Together with the
              company, you formulate a concrete question and you will start extracting data necessary to answer that question. Of
              course you also execute the analysis required. You will be supported by our staff to set up initial contacts, but
              after that: you’re on your own! Show the value of big data!
