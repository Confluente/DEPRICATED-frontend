<h1>History</h1>
<p>The idea of H.S.A. Confluente was conceived on the 15th of March 2015, when the members of the student council, together with the board of the Honors Academy, came up with the idea of setting up an association in order to create an honors community. The council members constituted the first board. Although Confluente was not an official association back then, the first board provided a solid base for future growth of the association and came up with a name, a mission statement and a lot of future plans. Furthermore, the name of the association was created: Confluente. Confluente means ‘to flow together’ in Spanish. The fact that students of H.S.A. Confluente originate from all studies is no coincidence.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the academic year 2015-2016, the first official board was installed. This board made a lot of effort trying to get the association running. Several committees were set up, financial plans were improved and preparations were made in order to turn H.S.A. Confluente into an official association. Finally, on January fourth, 2016, Confluente was officially founded and registered at the chamber of commerce. Thus, the Dies Natalis is the fourth of January.</p>
