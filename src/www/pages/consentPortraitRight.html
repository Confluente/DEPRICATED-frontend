    <h1>Portrait right</h1>
    <p>Portrait right is a privacy law in the Netherlands which is applicable to people that are in pictures. If at an
        event
        of H.S.A. Confluente a picture of you has been taken, then (most of the time) you get the rights over whether
        that
        picture can be used and where.</p>
    <p>At activities we make lots of pictures and we want to hang those pictures up in the honors room as well as post
        them
        on the website (for members only). By giving consent on this page, you give consent to H.S.A. Confluente to hang
        pictures of you in the honors room and post them on the website (for members only), without being asked if that
        is
        okay for every single picture. At any point in time you can still request pictures to be removed from any source
        as
        stated in the privacy policy.</p>
    <p>Giving consent here does not mean that you give consent to H.S.A. Confluente to post pictures on social media.
        For
        every picture we post on social media, we ask the people on those pictures if that is okay</p>
