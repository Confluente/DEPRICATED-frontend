<h1>About</h1>
<p>H.S.A. Confluente is the study association for students enrolled at the Honors Academy of the University of Technology Eindhoven. Its main aim is to make the experience of all honors students, both in the bachelor and the master phase, as enjoyable, educational, fun and enriching as possible. It strives to do so by arranging educational activities, such as lunch lectures, skill training, company visits and study trips, as well as fun activities such as drinks, laser questing and pub quizzes for all its members to enjoy.</p>
<p>Thereby, we try to achieve coherence among the students enrolled in the many different tracks that the Honors Academy houses, to bring together all current students and alumni into one big network of excellence!</p>
<p>H.S.A. Confluente attempts to harbor the individual learning processes of all its members. We welcome you to take initiative and take charge of your own learning besides your honors work. So if you have ideas for fun activities, a training, workshops or you want to help out in one of the committees or on the board, let us know, and we will do everything in our power to set you up for success!</p>
