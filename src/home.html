    <p>The Honors Study Association Confluente is the study association of the Honors Academy at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Our aim is to make the experience of all Honors students as enjoyable, educational, fun and enriching as possible. We strive to do so by arranging educational activities, such as lunch lectures, skill trainings, company visits and study trips, as well as fun activities such as monthly drinks, laser questing and pub quizzes for all our members to enjoy.</p>
